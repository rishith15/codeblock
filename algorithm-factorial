//Algorithm for Calculating Factorial
Input: Read and store the integer in variable n.
Output: Print the value of fact, which now contains the factorial of the originally entered number n.

Step 1: Display a message asking the user to enter an integer.
Step 2: Read the integer input from the user and store it in variable n.
Step 3: Initialize fact to 1, which serves as the initial value for calculating factorial.
Step 4: Enter a while loop with the condition n > 0.
Step 5: Inside the loop:
Update fact by multiplying it with the current value of n.
Decrement n by 1 to move towards calculating the factorial step by step.
Step 6: Once the loop terminates (when n becomes 0), print the value of fact.
Step 7: End the program.

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n) - The algorithm iterates n times in the while loop to calculate the factorial.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a few variables (n, fact) are used, regardless of the input size
